# Linear-Data-Structure-Visualization
Linear Data Structure Visualization - Stack,Queue,LinkedList
# INTRODUCTION
In this project, visualization of data structure operations like Push, Pop are showed up visually.<br>
It helps to teach visually instead of using common pen and paper to explain the opearaitons of stack, queue and Linked List.<br>
The aim of the proposed system is to overcome the problem of proper animations. 
# Technology Used
Java
Swings
UML Diagrams
# Explanation
This visualization tool allows students to see how an element is inserted into, or deleted form data structures. This tool gives an effective supplement to the traditional classromm education and textbooks for learning data structures.<br>
  a. Provides complete visualization for the widely used data structures such as stack, queue and circular queue which is limited to this project.<br>
  b. Provides the animation of common operations associated with the data structures, such as inserting an element into and deleting an element from stack, queue and circular queue.
# Program Visualization Process
1. Lexical Analysis : Converts sequence of characters into sequence of tokens.Lex is a tool for generating scanners.
2. Syntax Analysis : The output of lexical analyser is used to represent grammaticla structure of tokens. This analysis also called parsing.
3. Semantic Analysis : This checks meaning of the statement parsed in the parse tree. It comapres information in one part of the aprse tree tot hat in another part.
4. Visualizer : It is an interpreter which interprets the intermediate code and generates animated views of the program.
